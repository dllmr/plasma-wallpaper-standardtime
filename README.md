# plasma-wallpaper-standardtime

Video wallpaper plugin for KDE Plasma 6.

The sole function of this plugin is to play the Standard Time video synced to the PC's clock.

Standard Time is a 24-hour clock, continuously built by a team of people. The video file is therefore exactly 24 hours long.

The video must be bought separately from https://www.standard-time.com/. It comes packaged as a Windows screensaver, but of course you don't want to use that!
